Decimal Number to Binary List
By mr womp womp
Input: N= decimal number
Output: Ans= binary list

:2fPart(.5int(N2^seq(X,X,~int(logBASE(N,2)),0

Alternatively (older calcs):

2fPart(.5int(N2^seq(X,X,~int(log(N)/log(2)),0

For both input and output as integers: (By lirtosiat)

:int(2fPart(N/2^cumSum(binomcdf(44,0
:.1sum(Ans10^(cumSum(1 or Ans

For both input and output as integers (8-bit): (By PT_)

:2fPart(.5int(N2^seq(X,X,~7,0
