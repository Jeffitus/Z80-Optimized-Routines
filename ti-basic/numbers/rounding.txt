By lirtosiat and Trenly
Input: X= a number
Output: Ans= rounded number

:-int(-X                   //rounds towards +∞

:iPart(X+not(not(fPart(X   //rounds away from 0

Natural rounding (round down if decimal <= .4, round up if decimal is >= .5):

:iPart(X+(fPart(X)≥.5

Round towards nearest N or multiple of N:

:X/N->X
:NiPart(X+(fPart(X)≥.5
